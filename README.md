Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game often played in casinos. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value, without exceeding 21. Here are the basic rules of the game:

# Card Values:

Number cards (2-10): Their face value (e.g., a 5 is worth 5 points).
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): Each worth 10 points.
Ace: Can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player more. It's flexible and can change during the course of a hand.

# Gameplay:

Blackjack's goal is to get a hand close to 21 without exceeding it, beating the dealer. Players and the dealer are dealt two cards. Players' cards are face-up; the dealer has one upcard and one face-down (hole card).

Players choose actions based on hand value:

"Hit" for another card, aiming to get closer to 21.
"Stand" to keep current total.
"Surrender" forfeits half the bet if the hand seems weak.
After players act, the dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer must hit until 17 (or more) is reached. Some hit on "soft 17" (Ace-6), while others stand.

If the dealer busts (exceeds 21), players win. If not, hands are compared. Players with higher hands win.

These rules offer a concise overview of blackjack. Strategy involves judging card values, dealer's upcard, and making decisions to maximize winning chances while avoiding busting.
# Winning:

Players win even money on their bets if they have a higher hand total than the dealer without exceeding 21.
If a player's hand value is exactly 21, they have a "blackjack".
If the player's hand total exceeds 21, they bust and lose their bet.
It's important to note that blackjack rules can vary slightly between different casinos and regions. Before playing, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the specific rules of the game you're participating in.

# Our Objective:

Calculating the exact probabilities in blackjack can be quite complex due to the changing nature of the deck as cards are drawn.

In the first case, when the dealer's card is shown, calculating the probability(in %) of winning in blackjack involves considering the player's hand value and the dealer's visible card. By analyzing these factors, the player can estimate their chances of winning based on potential outcomes.

In the second case, when the dealer's card is shown and the player has two initial cards, the probabilities change based on whether the player chooses to "hit" (take an additional card) or "stand" (keep the current hand). 

If the player chooses "hit," the probability of winning depends on the likelihood of drawing a card that improves the hand without exceeding 21. 

If the player opts to "stand," the probability of winning is determined by the dealer's eventual hand and whether it surpasses 21 or not.

In both scenarios, the probabilities are influenced by card distribution, the composition of the deck, and the player's strategy. Understanding these probabilities can assist players in making informed decisions to enhance their chances of winning in the game of blackjack.hrough extensive simulations and calculations to maximize your chances of winning over the long term.

For precise probabilities in specific scenarios, you might need to use computer simulations or mathematical models that take into account the composition of the remaining deck and potential outcomes of each decision. Keep in mind that blackjack probabilities are influenced by various factors, including the number of decks in play and the specific rules of the game being used.
